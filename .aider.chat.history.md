A vibrant, stylized illustration of a zoo entrance with a large, welcoming archway. The archway is decorated with colorful vines and leaves, and a friendly, cartoon-style lion stands proudly in front of it, wearing a small explorer hat. Behind the lion, a clear blue sky with a few fluffy clouds sets a cheerful backdrop. The foreground features a winding path leading into the zoo, with subtle footprints and a small sign that reads “ZooMate” in bold, playful lettering. The overall composition is lively and inviting, designed to appeal to visitors of all ages.
